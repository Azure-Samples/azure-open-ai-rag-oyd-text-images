### Recap of Progress  
  
Let's summarize the steps we've completed so far in our workshop:  
  
1. **Reviewed the Use Case and Reference Architecture**  
   - Analyzed the specific requirements and objectives.  
   - Examined the reference architecture to understand the overall system design.  
  
2. **Set Up Azure OpenAI Resources**  
   - Created the **Azure OpenAI** resource.  
   - Deployed the **Chat** and **Embeddings** models to facilitate conversational AI capabilities.  
  
3. **Configured Azure AI Search**  
   - Established the **Azure AI Search** resource.  
   - Configured the search index to organize and manage searchable data efficiently.  
  
4. **Pre-Processed the PDF Document**  
   - Prepared the PDF document by extracting and cleaning the necessary data to ensure compatibility with our indexing process.  
  
5. **Populated the Azure AI Index**  
   - Imported the processed data from the PDF into the **Azure AI Search** index, enabling robust search functionality based on the document's content.  
  
### Next Steps  
  
With these foundational steps completed, we're now ready to move forward with the final phase:  
  
- **Setting Up the Demo Application**  
  - Integrate the configured services into a cohesive demo application.  
    
- **Implementing Document-Based Chat**  
  - Enable interactive chat functionality that interacts directly with the indexed documents, allowing participants to query and receive information seamlessly.  

Once the demo is up and running, you'll use the interface shown in the image below to execute your queries.
