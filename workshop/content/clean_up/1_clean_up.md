title: 'Azure Resource Clean Up'
---

It's always important to **clean up your environment** once you're done working in it. This helps avoid continuing to **incur any cloud costs**. Once you've concluded your testing, run the command below to **delete any Azure resources** that you created during this workshop. 

```bash {class="bash-class" id="bash-codeblock" lineNos=inline tabWidth=2}
bash ./helper.sh cleanup
```

Congratulations! You have successfully completed this workshop. Where do you go from here? Well, how about:

- [Checking out the source code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-open-ai-rag-oyd-text-images)
- Having a closer look at [further resources](/azure-open-ai-rag-oyd-text-images/further_resources/1_further_resources/)
- Maybe [starting the workshop all over](/azure-open-ai-rag-oyd-text-images/)
