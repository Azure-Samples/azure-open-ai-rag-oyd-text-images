## RAG On PDF With Text And Embedded Images, With Citations Referencing Image Answering User Query

<!-- In today's workshop you will learn how to use Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Search to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application with your own data. By offloading AI Search communication to Azure OpenAI, this solution not only enhances text-based queries but also provides a powerful way to identify and retrieve relevant images based on the user's query. This capability ensures that your query responses are enriched with relevant visual content whenever available. -->

In this self-paste workshop you will learn about some of the key Azure services to build an application with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities on your PDF documents with text and embedded Images, with citations referencing image answering user query.
